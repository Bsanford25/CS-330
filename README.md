How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

This project has helped me craft many new skills, specifically with OpenGL. Prior to this class I hadn't done too much with graphics. However, by following along with the videos and reading material I was able to learn how to add 3-D objects to a scene and make it interactive as well. The design process i followed was to visualize and write out where the objects should go and code them accordingly, after first understanding the requirements. I tried to have a clear vision of what i wanted to accomplish and how the 3-D scene should look before I started on the code. I then followed an agile approach in the sense I broke the project up into smaller, more manageable, chunks of work. This made the project much more manageable.


How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I approach developing programs by first understanding the requiremnts and what the end result is supposed to accomplish. 
My approach to developing code throughout the milestones was to look at what each milestone was supposed to do and break down the steps to do it. If and when i ran into an obstacle and got stuck, I would watch through the relevant videos and work through the parts where i had trouble. I was able to find my errors and adjust to meet the requireents. For example I ran into issues with applying textures, but after trying various different solutions to no avail, I found that resizing and changing the file type may help, which it did.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

computer science can help me accomplish my goals by allowing me to create new and innovative programs, that will be useful to society. Personally, this class has helped me in my educational and professional journey, becaiuse I know now that I can learn very complicated material if I really put my mind to it look at problems from every angle. I really enjoyed learning how to create the 3-D scenes as it combines both art and science and I really like the way those two combine in OpenGL.
